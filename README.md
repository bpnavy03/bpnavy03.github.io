# Course Planner - Enhancements Overview
 This repository contains the Course Planner project, which uses a Binary Search Tree (BST) to manage and search for college courses. The project has undergone three major enhancements, improving functionality, efficiency, and user interaction. A GUI has been implemented for a greater user experience.

# Features
üîπ Load course data from a CSV file into a BST

üîπ Search for courses by ID in BST

üîπ Sort courses by the number of prerequisites in BST

üîπ Interactive keyword-based search in BST (now case-insensitive!)

üîπ Load courses from MongoDB

üîπ Search for a course in MongoDB

# üöÄ Enhancements Summary

# Enhancement 1: C++ to Python Conversion
‚úÖ Converted the entire project from C++ to Python while maintaining original functionality.

‚úÖ Implemented Python‚Äôs csv module for file handling.

‚úÖ Replaced manual memory management from C++ with Python‚Äôs garbage collection.

# Enhancement 1 Narrative

The Course Planner was initially developed in C++ and later converted to Python to enhance readability, maintainability, and ease of use. The artifact was chosen for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to transition between programming languages while preserving functionality. This enhancement improved the program by leveraging Python‚Äôs built-in libraries for file handling and data structures, eliminating the need for manual memory management. Through this conversion, I demonstrated proficiency in software design principles, memory management, and data structure implementation.

Reflecting on this enhancement, I learned how to translate C++ logic into Python while maintaining efficiency. One of the challenges was ensuring that Python‚Äôs garbage collection system handled memory effectively, as opposed to C++‚Äôs manual allocation and deallocation. Another challenge was restructuring the file handling system to utilize Python‚Äôs CSV module instead of C++‚Äôs standard I/O operations. These challenges reinforced my understanding of software engineering principles, particularly how different languages handle memory and data structures. This enhancement met the course outcomes related to designing and evaluating computing solutions while improving program efficiency.

# Enhancement 2: Sorting & Interactive Search

‚úÖ Sorting courses by prerequisite count, improving data organization.

‚úÖ Interactive keyword-based search, allowing users to find courses dynamically.

‚úÖ Enhanced error handling and formatted output for a better user experience.

# Enhancement 2 Narrative

The second enhancement introduced sorting and an interactive search function to the Course Planner. This allowed users to organize courses based on the number of prerequisites and dynamically search for courses using keywords. The artifact was included in my ePortfolio because it showcases my ability to implement algorithmic solutions that enhance data accessibility and user experience. The introduction of sorting algorithms made prerequisite-based organization possible, while the interactive search feature improved usability by allowing users to find courses more efficiently.

This enhancement taught me that algorithm optimization directly impacts the user experience. One of the main challenges was modifying the Binary Search Tree (BST) to sort courses dynamically based on prerequisites instead of alphabetical order. Another challenge was implementing a keyword-based search feature while ensuring the BST maintained its efficiency. Overcoming these obstacles required refining my approach to data structures and algorithm implementation. This enhancement successfully met the course outcomes by improving data organization, optimizing searching and sorting techniques, and enhancing the program‚Äôs usability.

# Enhancement 3: Database Integration Using MongoDB

‚úÖ Implemented MongoDB for course storage, replacing in-memory BST for scalability.

‚úÖ Enabled persistent data storage, eliminating the need to reload courses on every run.

‚úÖ Developed MongoDB queries to efficiently retrieve and sort courses.

‚úÖ Enhanced search functionality, leveraging MongoDB's indexing for faster lookups.

‚úÖ Modified the program structure to interact with both CSV files and MongoDB.

# Enhancement 3 Narrative

The final enhancement integrated MongoDB into the Course Planner, allowing courses to be stored and retrieved from a NoSQL database in addition to CSV files. This update provided scalability, improved data persistence, and allowed users to switch between file-based storage and database queries. The artifact was selected for my ePortfolio because it highlights my ability to work with databases, optimize storage solutions, and apply real-world software engineering techniques. The transition from a BST-only structure to a hybrid CSV and MongoDB system demonstrated my ability to balance memory efficiency with persistent data storage.

Throughout this enhancement, I learned how to integrate a NoSQL database into an existing application while ensuring compatibility with previous functionality. Challenges included setting up a local MongoDB instance, designing the database schema to match the existing CSV structure, and ensuring seamless interaction between Python and MongoDB using pymongo. Additionally, implementing robust error handling and validation was crucial to maintaining data integrity. This enhancement met the course outcomes by demonstrating the ability to design scalable computing solutions, integrate databases, and ensure usability improvements.

# Finalized Enhanced Artifact with GUI

‚úÖ Introduced a Tkinter-based GUI for an improved user experience.

‚úÖ Designed a main window with buttons to load, search, and view courses.

‚úÖ Added input fields for user-friendly course searching.

‚úÖ Implemented list displays for course data from CSV and MongoDB.

‚úÖ Enhanced application accessibility by removing the need for command-line interaction.

# üí° Professional Self-Assessment
