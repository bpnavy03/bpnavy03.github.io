        <h2>Enhancements Summary</h2>

        <div class="enhancement">
            <h3>Enhancement 1: C++ to Python Conversion</h3>
            <p>The initial version of the Course Planner was implemented in <strong>C++</strong>. The first enhancement involved converting the program to <strong>Python</strong>, ensuring functional parity while leveraging Pythons simplicity and extensive libraries.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Converted <strong>Binary Search Tree (BST)</strong> implementation to Python.</li>
                <li>Handled <strong>file I/O operations</strong> using Pythons built-in <code>csv</code> module.</li>
                <li>Refactored <strong>C++ memory management</strong> into Pythons garbage collection system.</li>
            </ul>

            </a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="enhancement">
            <h3>Enhancement 1 Narrative</h3>
            <p>The Course Planner was initially developed in C++ and later converted to Python to enhance readability, maintainability, and ease of use. The artifact was chosen for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to transition between programming languages while preserving functionality. This enhancement improved the program by leveraging Python‚Äôs built-in libraries for file handling and data structures, eliminating the need for manual memory management. Through this conversion, I demonstrated proficiency in software design principles, memory management, and data structure implementation.</p> 
			<p>Reflecting on this enhancement, I learned how to translate C++ logic into Python while maintaining efficiency. One of the challenges was ensuring that Python‚Äôs garbage collection system handled memory effectively, as opposed to C++‚Äôs manual allocation and deallocation. Another challenge was restructuring the file handling system to utilize Python‚Äôs CSV module instead of C++‚Äôs standard I/O operations. These challenges reinforced my understanding of software engineering principles, particularly how different languages handle memory and data structures. This enhancement met the course outcomes related to designing and evaluating computing solutions while improving program efficiency.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="enhancement">
            <h3>Enhancement 2: Sorting & Interactive Search</h3>
            <p>The second enhancement introduced two major features: <strong>sorting courses by the number of prerequisites</strong> and an <strong>interactive search function</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented a <strong>sorting algorithm</strong> to organize courses based on prerequisite count.</li>
                <li>Developed an <strong>interactive keyword-based search</strong>, allowing users to find courses dynamically.</li>
                <li>Improved <strong>user experience</strong> with enhanced error handling and formatted output.</li>
            </ul>

            </a></p>
        </div>
		
        <div class="enhancement">
            <h3>Enhancement 2 Narrative</h3>
            <p>The second enhancement introduced sorting and an interactive search function to the Course Planner. This allowed users to organize courses based on the number of prerequisites and dynamically search for courses using keywords. The artifact was included in my ePortfolio because it showcases my ability to implement algorithmic solutions that enhance data accessibility and user experience. The introduction of sorting algorithms made prerequisite-based organization possible, while the interactive search feature improved usability by allowing users to find courses more efficiently.</p> 
			<p>This enhancement taught me that algorithm optimization directly impacts the user experience. One of the main challenges was modifying the Binary Search Tree (BST) to sort courses dynamically based on prerequisites instead of alphabetical order. Another challenge was implementing a keyword-based search feature while ensuring the BST maintained its efficiency. Overcoming these obstacles required refining my approach to data structures and algorithm implementation. This enhancement successfully met the course outcomes by improving data organization, optimizing searching and sorting techniques, and enhancing the program‚Äôs usability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="enhancement">
            <h3>Enhancement 3: Database Integration Using MongoDB</h3>
            <p>The third enhancement replaces the previous <strong>BST-only structure</strong> with a <strong>MongoDB database</strong>, providing persistent storage and better scalability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stored course data in <strong>MongoDB</strong>, allowing data to persist beyond program execution.</li>
                <li>Developed <strong>MongoDB queries</strong> for course retrieval and searching.</li>
                <li>Enabled <strong>dual functionality</strong>, allowing users to choose between CSV or DB-based operations.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
		
        <div class="enhancement">
            <h3>Enhancement 3 Narrative</h3>
            <p>The final enhancement integrated MongoDB into the Course Planner, allowing courses to be stored and retrieved from a NoSQL database in addition to CSV files. This update provided scalability, improved data persistence, and allowed users to switch between file-based storage and database queries. The artifact was selected for my ePortfolio because it highlights my ability to work with databases, optimize storage solutions, and apply real-world software engineering techniques. The transition from a BST-only structure to a hybrid CSV and MongoDB system demonstrated my ability to balance memory efficiency with persistent data storage.</p> 
			<p>Throughout this enhancement, I learned how to integrate a NoSQL database into an existing application while ensuring compatibility with previous functionality. Challenges included setting up a local MongoDB instance, designing the database schema to match the existing CSV structure, and ensuring seamless interaction between Python and MongoDB using pymongo. Additionally, implementing robust error handling and validation was crucial to maintaining data integrity. This enhancement met the course outcomes by demonstrating the ability to design scalable computing solutions, integrate databases, and ensure usability improvements.</p>

        <div class="enhancement">
            <h3>Finalized Enhanced Artifact with GUI</h3>
            <p>Introduced a <strong>Tkinter-based GUI</strong> for an <strong>improved user experience</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed a main window with buttons to load, search, and view courses.</li>
                <li>Added input fields for user-friendly course searching.</li>
                <li>Implemented list displays for course data from CSV and MongoDB.</li>
				<li>Enhanced application accessibility by removing the need for command-line interaction.</li>
            </ul>
